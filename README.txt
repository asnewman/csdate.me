   - update user settings page w/ upload page (Ash)
   - icon takes to home page (Ash)
   - remove picture (Jason)
   - click username to go to their profile (Ash)
   - Main page paging/5 per page (yikes)
   - questions results --> results (Sigal)
   - work on error page (Ash)
   - don't let the user that's logged in show up in the deep search (Jason)
   - finish algorithm for the rest of the attributes (Sigal)
   - restrictions on creation of usernames/passwords
